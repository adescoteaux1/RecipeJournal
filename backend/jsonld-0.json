Use your hands to toss in the flour, then use your fingers to smush the cubes of butter into the flour. Repeat, working your way through the mixture, until all of the butter is roughly pea-sized or smaller, or well-smashed. Add the sour cream and use a fork or spatula to mix, then switch to your hands to form it into a dough.  Spread out a piece of plastic wrap on the counter and transfer the dough on top. Form into an approximate square, about an inch thick. Wrap up and place in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 2 days."

Gently lift the edges so that the crust is flush with the filling. Fold the edges over a couple of times so that the crust has a clean edge all the way around that is flush with the pan. Brush the top of the crust with a very thin layer of milk or cream and sprinkle generously with sugar, if using. Use a sharp paring knife to cut about 6 vents in the top, each 1 to 2 inches long."

Depending on your oven, you may want to rotate the pan halfway through for even browning. While the pandowdy is still hot, use the edge of a spoon to crack the crust in several places, allowing a little of the juicy filling to seep through. It’s supposed to look messy. Let cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. Pandowdy can be served warm or room temperature. Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days on the counter and 4 days in the fridge.

Didn&#x27;t use the berries and reduced the sugar to half cup since the peaces were very sweet. Omitted the sugar topping since I don&#x27;t care for a crunchy topping."
